**1. values added:  20**\
**2. find result:  20**\
**3. values added:  20**\
**4. returns error, because we change the 'var' into let from question "1 and 2" code. And 'let' can only be accessed within the block it is defined in. THis is differnet from 'var'. And in this code, result is in the if statement, and when we call it out of the if statement, it is not defined in. So, we can't use it.**\
**5 and 6. returns error. Because const prevents it from being reassigned after it is assigned for the first time, and in the line 7 we have the code "result = num1+ num2;" which want to change its variable, this is not allowed.**
